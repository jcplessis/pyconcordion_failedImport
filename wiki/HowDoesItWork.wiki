#summary How does PyConcordion works

PyConcordion is fully based on Concordion, here is the idea :

    * Your python test class is deployed into an xml-rpc server,
    * a Java concordion test case source code is generated from your python class, each method of your python class becomes a method in the java class and this method makes an xml-rpc call to the python server
    * the Java class is compiled and run as a JUnit test
    * and Concordion handles everything else.
