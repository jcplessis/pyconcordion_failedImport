#summary Current restrictions about PyConcordion

= Introduction =

A few restrictions are placed on current version of !PyConcordion, due to lack of time or technical problems.


= Details =

  * All your test methods should return a value that is not `None`. This is due to some xml-rpc restriction.
  * assertTrue as well as annotations are not supported (release 0.1 is based on Concordion 1.2.0)
  * You have to follow naming conventions (same as in Concordion itself) that are :
      * `MyPage.html` for you test specification
      * `MyPageTest.py` containing a class named `MyPageTest` for your fixture
