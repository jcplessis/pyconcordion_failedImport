= Introduction =

This is a (very) short example to show how to use PyConcordion.
In 2 minutes you should see what it really provides and how to write a test.

= Details =

In a folder we create two files : MyExampleTest.py and MyExample.html _(note that the naming is enforced by PyConcordion, if the html is called *X.html*, your fixture must be called *XTest.py* and contain a class whose name is *XTest*)_

Here is the content of MyExampleTest.py :
{{{
#! /usr/bin/python

class MyExampleTest:

   def getMessage(self):
      return "Concordion supports python"

}}}

Here is the content of the html file : 

{{{
<html xmlns:concordion="http://www.concordion.org/2007/concordion">
<body>

    <h1>Python integration</h1>

    <p>
       <code>pyConcordion</code> let you write concordion test cases in python.
    </p>

    <div class="example">

        <h3>Example</h3>

                <p>This test is the proof.</p>

                <p concordion:assertEquals="getMessage()">Concordion supports python</p>
    </div>


</body>
</html>
}}}

Now you can run the test by simply running the python script provided: 
  _python2.6 folder_runner.py folder_containing_tests_

You should get an output looking like :
{{{
JUnit version 3.8.2
./tmp/MyExample.html
Successes: 1, Failures: 0


Time: 0,729

OK (1 test)
}}}

And the generated html file should be like :

And voil√† !
