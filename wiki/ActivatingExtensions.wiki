#summary How to activate extensions.

= Introduction =

Since release 0.8 pyconcordion supports some of [http://code.google.com/p/concordion-extensions/ concordion-extensions]. Here is a small tutorial of how to activate extensions and use them.


= Details =

By default no extension is activated, to activate them provide the extension name either when launching `concordion_folder_runner` with -e option set or by modifying the config.ini that is available in your _dist_package_ directory.


Example to activate all the concordion-extensions : concordion_folder_runner -e org.concordion.ext.Extensions *your_test_directory*

To activate only one or several extensions you can use a comma separated list of extensions to activate. Correct values are :
   * org.concordion.ext.TimestampFormatterExtension
   * org.concordion.ext.ScreenshotExtension
   * org.concordion.ext.EmbedExtension

concordion-extensions provides:
   * a screenshot extension,
   * a logging extension (not working with pyconcordion),
   * a timestamp extension (automatically used without html tag),
   * a translator extension (not working with pyconcordion),
   * an embed html extension.

The screenshot extension is used as in concordion (no python code required), embed html is used as in concordion except you write your method in python. Check [http://code.google.com/p/pyconcordion/source/browse/trunk/examples/screenshot/ScreenshotExample.html  the example in the source of this project].
