#summary How to work with pyConcordion under unix systems
#labels Linux

To use _pyConcordion_ under unix :
   * Download the latest version, extract and run _python setup.py install_ from extract directory
   * If java and javac are not in your normal PATH either :
       * edit your PATH environment variable 
       * or edit configuration file _/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/concordion/config.ini_ to set the command line to use.
   * From the directory containing your tests run the following command _concordion_folder_runner ._
   * The command should output something like :
{{{
./tmp/pyConcordion/./my.html
Successes: 1, Failures: 0


Time: 0,813

OK (1 test)
}}}
   * Your executed test files are available under _/tmp/pyConcordion_ by default.
   * To change output directory either :
      * modify _/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/concordion/config.ini_ 
      * or use the -o option (_concordion_folder_runner -o /home/jcplessis/myResulFolder ._)
